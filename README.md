# HECM  
### Holographic Entangled Coherence Model — Node in the Coherence Lineage

## Overview
The Holographic Entangled Coherence Model (HECM) extends the Coherence Mirror Framework into a holographic representational environment capable of modeling individual and collective reasoning across the **three foundational mirrors**: empirical, conceptual, and axiological.

This repository is an example of an **Active Manuscript**:  
a scholarly artifact that is both a conceptual model and an executable cognitive architecture.

## Lineage
ECM-Framework (root)  
? CMF-Framework (node)  
? HECM (node)  
? CMF-Diamond (branch)  
? HECM-Diamond (branch)

## Purpose
HECM defines the holographic substrate and coherence structures that support multi-agent reasoning, collective world models, and cross-domain alignment.  
It generalizes the CMF-Framework into a representational environment suitable for modeling scientific, organizational, and socio-technical systems.

## Three-Mirror Architecture
HECM inherits the **three-mirror structure** from ECM and CMF-Framework:
- Empirical  
- Conceptual  
- Axiological  

These mirrors interact within a unified holographic substrate, enabling resonance-based coherence across individuals and populations.

The **Social Mirror** is *not* part of HECM.  
It is introduced downstream in **CMF-Diamond** and inherited by **HECM-DIAMOND**.
