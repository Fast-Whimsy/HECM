\# HECM — Holographic Entangled Coherence Model



This repository contains the reference implementation of the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model (HECM), including:



\- core mathematical operators  

\- coherence and resonance metrics  

\- population dynamics  

\- simulation tools  

\- documentation and examples  



This is the canonical home for the model and its evolving research program.
