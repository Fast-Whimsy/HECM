\# HECM v0.1.0 — The Coherence Layer

\## The Mesh and the Grain



The coherence layer is the foundational substrate of the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model (HECM).  

It defines the simplest possible field structure and the minimal operator that governs how a field stabilizes, smooths, and self‑organizes.



This layer is intentionally minimal.  

It is the mesh — the first structural weave — and within that mesh lies the grain, the smallest stable pattern that persists through all higher layers of the model.



Grain is the mnemonic attractor of the entire HECM arc.

\## 1. Purpose of the Coherence Layer



The coherence layer answers a single, essential question:



\*\*How does a field maintain internal stability and identity before interacting with anything else?\*\*



This layer provides:

\- a field representation  

\- a local update rule  

\- a smoothing / stabilization operator  

\- the conceptual seed (grain) from which all higher layers emerge  



Everything in HECM grows from this grain.

\## 2. Field Representation



A coherence field is represented as a function:



\*\*Fᵢ(x)\*\*



where:

\- \*i\* indexes the field  

\- \*x\* is a point in a domain  

\- \*Fᵢ(x)\* is the coherence magnitude  



This is the mathematical expression of grain — the smallest stable pattern.

\## 3. Grain: The Local Invariant



Grain is the smallest stable pattern a field can express under the coherence operator.



It is:

\- the local texture of the field  

\- the micro‑structure that persists through smoothing  

\- the identity‑bearing pattern that higher layers inherit  



Grain is not added — it emerges.



---



\## 4. The Local Coherence Operator



The coherence operator updates a field based solely on its own structure:



\- each value becomes a weighted blend of nearby values  

\- weights decay with distance  

\- the operator is normalized  

\- the update is stable under iteration  



This operator stabilizes grain and reinforces local structure.

\## 5. Why Coherence Comes First



Coherence is the only layer that does not require:

\- beams  

\- networks  

\- cross‑field constraints  

\- population‑level structure  



It is the atomic behavior of a field.



Every higher layer depends on it.

\## 6. Relationship to Later Layers



The coherence layer is not replaced — it is contained.



\- v0.2.0 adds entanglement  

\- v0.3.0 adds population dynamics  

\- v1.0.0 adds attractor evolution  



The mesh contains the grain.  

The fabric contains the mesh.  

The suit contains the fabric.

\## 7. Summary



The coherence layer provides:

\- the field representation  

\- the local update rule  

\- the smoothing kernel  

\- the emergence of grain  

\- the base for all future operators  



It is the first stone in the HECM architecture.



Everything else grows from this grain.
