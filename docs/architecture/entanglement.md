\# HECM v0.2.0 — The Entanglement Layer

\## From Mesh to Fabric



The entanglement layer extends the coherence layer by introducing information beams — structured channels that transmit grain between fields.  

Where coherence defines grain within a single field, entanglement defines how grain becomes shared across multiple fields.



This is the moment the mesh begins to behave like fabric.

\## 1. Purpose of the Entanglement Layer



The entanglement layer answers:



\*\*How do two coherence fields influence one another in a structured, symmetric, and stable way?\*\*



This layer introduces:

\- pairwise coupling  

\- beam operators  

\- shared constraints  

\- the first non‑local behavior  



---



\## 2. Beams: Channels of Shared Grain



An entanglement beam connects two fields:



\*\*Fᵢ ↔ Fⱼ\*\*



A beam:

\- transmits grain  

\- preserves identity  

\- creates shared micro‑structure  

\- is symmetric in influence  



Beams do not overwrite grain — they blend it.



---



\## 3. The Entanglement Operator



Each field receives a shaped, weighted contribution of the other’s grain:



\- each field keeps its own coherence  

\- each receives a filtered version of the other  

\- the beam defines what grain is transmitted  

\- updates remain stable  



This is the grain‑sharing mechanism.



---



\## 4. Beam Structure



A beam has:

1\. \*\*Strength\*\*  

2\. \*\*Shape\*\*  

3\. \*\*Symmetry\*\*  



This ensures entanglement is:

\- stable  

\- interpretable  

\- extensible

\## 5. Grain in the Entanglement Layer



Grain becomes:

\- shared  

\- correlated  

\- co‑expressed  

\- the seed of population‑level patterns  



The grain of one field becomes part of the grain of another.



This is the beginning of fabric.

\## 6. Relationship to Later Layers



Entanglement is the foundation for:

\- population dynamics (v0.3.0)  

\- attractor evolution (v1.0.0)  



The mesh remains.  

The grain remains.  

But now the grain is shared.



---



\## 7. Summary



The entanglement layer provides:

\- pairwise coupling  

\- beam operators  

\- shared grain transmission  

\- the first non‑local structure  



It is the second stone in the HECM architecture.
