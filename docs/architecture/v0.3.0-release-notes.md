\# HECM v0.3.0 — Population Layer



This release introduces the third layer of the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model (HECM): population dynamics.



\## New Features



\### 1. qf\_population\_update

A population-level operator that:

\- applies coherence implicitly through field stability

\- applies entanglement across a beam network

\- supports weighted adjacency matrices

\- supports optional global constraints



\### 2. Population Network Example

`examples/population\_network\_demo.py` demonstrates:

\- grain propagation across a network

\- cluster formation

\- early emergent structure

\- optional normalization constraints



\## Documentation

The population layer is fully documented in:

`docs/architecture/population.md`



\## Conceptual Summary

v0.3.0 thickens the entanglement layer into the population layer:

\- beams become networks

\- grain becomes distributed

\- structure becomes emergent

\- the fabric begins to hold form



This release is the third stone in the HECM architecture.
