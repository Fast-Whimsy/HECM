\# QF Prelude — Minimal Mathematical Intuition for HECM

\## The Skeleton Beneath the Suit



The QF Prelude provides the minimal mathematical intuition underlying HECM.  

It is not a full formalism — it is the skeleton that ties coherence, entanglement, population dynamics, and attractor evolution together.

\# 1. Fields as Functions



A coherence field is:



\*\*Fᵢ(x)\*\*



This is the mathematical expression of grain.



---



\# 2. Local Coherence Operator



The coherence operator:



\*\*Fᵢ′(x) = Σᵧ K(x,y) Fᵢ(y)\*\*



\- K is a smoothing kernel  

\- weights decay with distance  

\- operator is normalized  



This stabilizes grain.



---



\# 3. Entanglement Operator



Pairwise coupling:



\*\*Fᵢ′ = Fᵢ + α Bᵢⱼ\[Fⱼ]\*\*  

\*\*Fⱼ′ = Fⱼ + α Bⱼᵢ\[Fᵢ]\*\*



This shares grain.



---



\# 4. Population Operator



Networked dynamics:



\*\*Fᵢ′ = C\[Fᵢ] + Σⱼ wᵢⱼ Eᵢⱼ\[Fᵢ, Fⱼ]\*\*



This distributes grain.



---



\# 5. Constraint Operator



Global projector:



\*\*F′ ← Q\[F′]\*\*



This stabilizes the population.



---



\# 6. Attractors as Fixed Points



An attractor satisfies:



\*\*Q ∘ P\[F] ≈ F\*\*



This is global identity.



---



\# 7. Attractor Evolution



Under slow drift:



\*\*A(t+Δt) ≈ A(t) + ε ΔA\*\*



This is identity adapting smoothly.



---



\# 8. Summary



\- Fields express grain  

\- Coherence stabilizes grain  

\- Entanglement shares grain  

\- Population dynamics distribute grain  

\- Attractors preserve grain as identity  



This is the mathematical skeleton of HECM.
