\# HECM v1.0.0 — The Attractor Layer

\## From Form to Identity



The attractor layer is the culmination of HECM.  

Where population dynamics give the system form, attractors give it identity — stable, self‑maintaining patterns that persist through time.



This is the moment the suit holds its shape.

\## 1. Purpose of the Attractor Layer



The attractor layer answers:



\*\*How does a population of entangled fields settle into stable global patterns, and how do those patterns evolve over time?\*\*



This layer introduces:

\- population‑level attractors  

\- attractor basins  

\- identity‑preserving evolution  

\- adaptation under slow drift

\## 2. What Is an Attractor?



An attractor is a stable global pattern:



\- a distributed configuration of grain  

\- persistent under perturbation  

\- stabilized by coherence, entanglement, and constraints  



Attractors are the identity of the system.

\## 3. Attractor Basins



A basin is the region of state space from which the system converges to an attractor.



Basins:

\- emerge from the beam network  

\- are shaped by constraints  

\- define long‑term behavior  



This is the cut of the suit.

\## 4. The Attractor Evolution Operator



The operator:

1\. detects the current basin  

2\. updates the population within that basin  

3\. adapts the attractor under slow drift  

4\. maintains stability  



This is identity‑preserving evolution.

\## 5. Grain in the Attractor Layer



Grain becomes:

\- global texture  

\- identity  

\- the stable pattern the system returns to  



The grain of the system becomes the identity of the system.

\## 6. Stability and Adaptation



Attractors exhibit:

\- stability under perturbation  

\- adiabatic adaptation under slow drift  



This is the suit moving with the wearer.



---



\## 7. Summary



The attractor layer provides:

\- global attractors  

\- basins  

\- identity‑preserving evolution  

\- stability and adaptation  



It is the fourth stone in the HECM architecture.
