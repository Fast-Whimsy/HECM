\# HECM v0.3.0 — The Population Layer

\## From Fabric to Form



The population layer extends entanglement by introducing networks of fields and multi‑field dynamics.  

Where entanglement weaves grain between pairs, population dynamics weave grain across entire networks.



This is the moment fabric begins to behave like form.

\## 1. Purpose of the Population Layer



The population layer answers:



\*\*How does a network of entangled fields evolve together as a coherent whole?\*\*



This layer introduces:

\- population‑level update rules  

\- beam networks  

\- shared constraints  

\- emergent global patterns

\## 2. Beam Networks: Fabric from Threads



Beams form networks:



\*\*F₁ ↔ F₂ ↔ F₃ ↔ … ↔ Fₙ\*\*



A beam network:

\- defines influence  

\- propagates grain  

\- creates multi‑field correlations  

\- supports emergent structure  



This is fabric.

\## 3. The Population Update Operator



Each field updates based on:

1\. its own coherence  

2\. the influence of entangled neighbors  

3\. global constraints  



This operator:

\- synchronizes patterns  

\- forms clusters  

\- produces global modes  



It is the grain‑propagating mechanism that turns fabric into form.

\## 4. Shared Constraints: The Tailor



Global constraints:

\- stabilize the population  

\- shape emergent patterns  

\- prevent divergence  

\- maintain coherence  



This is the suit beginning to hold shape.

\## 5. Grain in the Population Layer



Grain becomes:

\- distributed  

\- coordinated  

\- population‑level texture  

\- the seed of global attractors  



The grain of the network becomes the identity of the system.



---



\## 6. Emergent Behavior



Population dynamics produce:

\- synchronized oscillations  

\- coherent clusters  

\- stable global patterns  

\- population‑level attractors  



This is collective identity.



---



\## 7. Summary



The population layer provides:

\- networked entanglement  

\- multi‑field dynamics  

\- global constraints  

\- emergent structure  



It is the third stone in the HECM architecture.
