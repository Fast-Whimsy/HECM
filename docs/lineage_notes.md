\# Lineage Notes for the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model (HECM)



This document records the developmental lineage of the Holographic Entangled Coherence Model.  

It explains how HECM emerged from the CMF‑Framework and why it occupies a distinct node  

in the coherence lineage.



\## 1. Origins

HECM began as an effort to generalize the CMF‑Framework into a holographic representational  

environment capable of modeling multi‑agent reasoning and collective world models.



\## 2. Extension of the Tri‑Mirror Structure

HECM inherits the three foundational mirrors—empirical, conceptual, and axiological—  

from ECM and CMF‑Framework.  

Its early development focused on preserving this irreducible structure while enabling  

higher‑order representational dynamics.



\## 3. Holographic Substrate Development

The key innovation of HECM was the introduction of a holographic substrate:  

a representational environment where coherence fields can be projected, compared,  

and transformed across agents and populations.



\## 4. Multi‑Agent and Ensemble Modeling

HECM introduced structures for population ensembles, shared bubbles, and bridge agents.  

These concepts enabled the modeling of collective reasoning and cross‑agent alignment.



\## 5. Operator Expansion

HECM extended the operator set inherited from CMF to support holographic transformations,  

resonance structures, and cross‑domain alignment processes.



\## 6. Preparation for High‑Resolution Branching

As the model matured, it became clear that a high‑resolution branch would be needed  

to support fine‑grained coherence analysis.  

This led to the development of HECM‑DIAMOND.



These lineage notes document the evolution of HECM and its role as a node  

in the coherence lineage.
